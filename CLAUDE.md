# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Session Memory Protocol

**At the start of every session**, read the files in `/memory/` to restore context:

- `memory/user.md` — who the user is, their background and working style
- `memory/preferences.md` — coding and workflow preferences for this project
- `memory/decisions.md` — past architectural and technical decisions
- `memory/people.md` — collaborators and stakeholders

**At the end of every session** (when the user says goodbye, wraps up, or asks to end), update the relevant memory files with anything learned during the session: new decisions made, preferences expressed, feedback given, or new information about people involved.

## Project Overview

Questarr is a video game management app inspired by the \*Arr ecosystem (Sonarr, Radarr). Users discover, track, and download games via automated indexer search and download client integration. Dark-themed UI built around visual game covers.

## Design Context

### Users

Questarr is for self-hosting game collectors and power users who manage discovery, tracking, and downloads from a browser-based dashboard. On mobile, they are often checking status, searching for a title, reviewing availability, or triggering a quick action while away from their desk. The primary mobile job to be done is fast, confident control of the library from a phone in portrait orientation, with tablet support as a secondary context.

### Brand Personality

Questarr should feel focused, capable, and trustworthy. The current product language already points to a privacy-conscious, dark-first, cover-led interface built for enthusiasts; on mobile that should translate into a fast and utility-first experience rather than a decorative or playful one. The emotional goal is confidence through clarity: users should feel that core actions are always within reach and never fragile on small screens.

### Aesthetic Direction

Keep the dark-first, media-rich Questarr identity, but adapt it into a denser thumb-friendly control surface for phones. Preserve strong cover art, blue primary accents, and clear status color cues, while reducing visual chrome, avoiding cramped multi-column layouts, and prioritizing stacked flows, sticky context, and touchable surfaces. Mobile should feel like a deliberate field console for managing a game library, not a scaled-down desktop admin panel.

### Design Principles

1. Thumb-first navigation: primary actions and key navigation must stay reachable and comfortable with one-handed use.
2. Speed over ornament: mobile layouts should surface the next useful action immediately and avoid decorative complexity that slows scanning.
3. Preserve capability: core desktop functionality must remain available on mobile, but reorganized through progressive disclosure instead of compression.
4. Cover-led clarity: game art and status signals should remain the visual anchor, with metadata condensed into scannable layers.
5. Touch-safe density: interfaces can stay information-rich, but all controls need forgiving spacing and touch targets sized for real phones.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev              # Dev server with hot reload (port 5000)

npm start                # Run production server from dist/
npm run check            # TypeScript type checking (no emit)

npm run lint             # ESLint
npm run lint:fix         # ESLint with auto-fix

```

## Architecture

Three-layer TypeScript app with a single `package.json` (not a monorepo):

- **`/client/src`** — React 18 SPA. Wouter routing, TanStack React Query for server state, shadcn/ui + Radix primitives, Tailwind CSS 4. Pages are code-split with `React.lazy`. Pages: library, discover, search, wishlist, calendar, downloads, indexers, downloaders, rss, xrel-releases, stats, settings.
- **`/server`** — Express REST API + Socket.io WebSockets. JWT auth (bcryptjs), express-validator for input validation, Pino logging, SSRF-protected fetch.
- **`/shared`** — Drizzle ORM schema (`schema.ts`), Zod validation schemas (derived from Drizzle), game title normalization (`title-utils.ts`), download categorization.

### Data flow

1. Frontend uses React Query to call Express REST endpoints
2. Routes validate input (express-validator + Zod), call storage/service layers
3. Storage layer uses Drizzle ORM against SQLite (better-sqlite3)
4. Real-time updates pushed via Socket.io (download progress, notifications)

### Database

SQLite with Drizzle ORM. Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`. Migrations in `/migrations/`. Key tables: `users`, `userSettings`, `systemConfig`, `games`, `indexers`, `downloaders`, `gameDownloads`, `notifications`, `rssFeeds`, `rssFeedItems`, `xrelNotifiedReleases`, `releaseBlacklist`.

Notable game fields added: `steamAppId`, `hidden` (boolean), `userRating` (0.5–10 scale), `source` ("manual" | "steam" | "api"). User fields: `steamId64`. UserSettings fields: `preferredReleaseGroups`, `steamSyncFailures`.

## Code Conventions

- **TypeScript strict mode**, no `any`. Unused params prefixed with `_`.
- **Path aliases**: `@/*` → `client/src/*`, `@shared/*` → `shared/*`
- **ES modules** throughout (`"type": "module"` in package.json)
- **Prettier**: 100 char width, 2 spaces, trailing comma ES5
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Husky + lint-staged runs ESLint + Prettier on staged files
- **Commit messages**: Start with a verb ("Add", "Fix", "Update"), reference issues when applicable
- **Frontend styling**: Tailwind CSS utility classes, dark-first theme with CSS variables. Colors: primary blue `#3B82F6`, secondary emerald `#10B981`, background dark slate `#1F2937`.
- **Components**: Functional, TypeScript interfaces for props, Radix UI for interactive primitives

### React Performance

- Wrap expensive computations in `useMemo`; wrap stable callbacks passed as props or used in dependency arrays in `useCallback`.
- Prefer deriving state via `useMemo` over storing redundant state that can be computed from existing state/props.

### Accessibility

- All interactive elements must have an accessible label: use `aria-label` on icon-only buttons/controls, `htmlFor` + `id` pairs on form fields, and `aria-labelledby` when a visible heading already describes the region.
- Use semantic HTML elements (`<button>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`) rather than `<div>` with click handlers.
- Radix UI primitives handle most ARIA roles automatically — avoid duplicating role attributes they already set.

## Testing

- **Unit tests**: Vitest with `@testing-library/react` (client) and supertest (server). Tests use in-memory SQLite.
- **E2E tests**: Playwright. Run against `dev:test` server on port 5100.
- **Test files**: `server/__tests__/` and `client/__tests__/`
- **Setup**: `tests/setup.ts` provides ResizeObserver mocks and test env vars

## UI Changes

Any PR that touches `client/src/**` must include visual evidence (a screenshot or short recording) of the change actually running, in the PR description — not just passing unit tests. Use the `run` skill to launch `npm run dev:test`, drive the page with a headless browser, and capture the screenshot or recording before opening or updating the PR. Type checking and test suites verify code correctness, not visual/behavioral correctness — visual evidence is the only way to confirm the UI actually looks and works as intended.

## Environment Variables

Key vars (see `.env.example`):

- `RAWG_API_KEY` — RAWG API key (optional; a key saved in Settings takes precedence)
- `SQLITE_DB_PATH` — Database file path (default: `sqlite.db`)
- `JWT_SECRET` — JWT signing secret (auto-generated if unset)
- `PORT` — Server port (default: 5000)
- `NODE_ENV` — `development` | `production` | `test`
